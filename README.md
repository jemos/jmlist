jmlist v0.1

Implementation of Dynamic Lists in C

INTRODUCTION
============

Tired of using/creating/modifying my code on different projects to
use dynamic lists I decided to create this code for future reuse.
This is something well implemented in most of higher level languages,
although I didn't found many code of C implementations.

The objective was to abstract most of the structure behind the
dynamic list while allowing to implement basic list types (indexed,
linked, associative) with basic routines available for all types.

This means you can index' access the linked or associative list,
push or pop from the indexed lists, etc.

Of course, each list type has specific access characteristics, for
some types of access is better one list instead of the other.

FEATURES
--------

 * Three basic lists supported: indexed, linked and key based.
 * Memory usage numbers

INSTALATION
===========

This is not a package, it's just source code, link it with your code
and thats it.

Build Options
-------------

If the preprocessor variable `JMLDEBUG` is defined, jmlist_debug will
be active and debugging output will be generated for all jmlist
functions. The `jmlist` object requires -std=c99 to be used when
compiling it. 

Included Programs
-----------------

The source code includes a simple benchmark tool (`jmlist_benchmark`) to have some speed
numbers with this functions. These are some sample results (CPU Core 2 Duo 2Ghz).

| List Type   | Insert Time (k entry/s) | Access Time (k entry/s) |
|:-----------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
|  Indexed    |            17.55        |     49600               |
|   Linked    |            10780        |     7.95                |
| Associative |            6345         |     18.26               |

We would expect indexed to be faster in access time and slower to
insert, the contrary in the linked list type. Note that "indexed"
access is done on the linked list.

Besides the benchmark tool there's a test tool which was used to
test code implementation of some functionality (`jmlist_test`).


USAGE TUTORIAL
==============

Lets start with a simple example of indexed lists. jmlist must be
initialized before it can be used, that will allow one to specify
the debugging output file descriptor, internal list usage or not,
besides others.

Before starting with code, all `jmlist_*` functions return a status
code, which you can look for success with `JMLIST_ERROR_SUCCESS`.
If it returns `JMLIST_ERROR_FAILURE`, look for jmlist_errno variable
contents, its also a status code but more specific.

First do the jmlist module initialization:

	jmlist_status status;
	struct _jmlist_init_params init_params = {
		.fdump = stdout, .fdebug = stdout,
		.fverbose = stdout, .flags = JMLIST_FLAG_DEBUG
	};
	status = jmlist_initialize(&init_params);

The .fdump file descriptor is used for `jmlist_dump` output. Use If everthing went OK, status should be `JMLIST_ERROR_SUCCESS`. If not you can use jmlist_status_to_string to help output something readable.


	struct _jmlist_params params = { .flags = JMLIST_INDEXED };
	status = jmlist_create(&jml,&params);

	/* We can now add entries to the list.. */
	status = jmlist_insert(jml,"ABC");
	status = jmlist_insert(jml,"DEF");
	status = jmlist_insert(jml,"GHI\n");

	/* Now lets get the entries and print them.. */
	jmlist_index max_i;
	jmlist_get_count(jml,&i);

	for( int jmlist_index i = 0 ; i < max_i < i++ )
	{
		char *ptr;
		jmlist_get_by_index(jml,i,ptr);
		printf("%s",ptr);
	}

	/* now clear the list */
	status = jmlist_free(jml);

This example shows basic usage of jmlist.

Using Linked Lists
------------------

*TODO*


Using Associative Lists
-----------------------

Set the flag to JMLIST_ASSOCIATIVE and then you can use `jmlist_get_by_key`,
`jmlist_insert_with_key`, `jmlist_remove_by_key`. The key is considered binary
data so you can use both a string or anything else.

For example:

	...
	char *key = "my_key";
	void *data = ...
	s = jmlist_insert_with_key(jml,key,strlen(key),data);
	...
	s = jmlist_get_by_key(jml,key,strlen(key),&data);
	...

The new data pointer should be equal to the old one. If you insert two entries
with the same key, jmlist will ignore that fact, you'll have duplicate key in
the list. If you try to get by key a duplicate key it will return the first it
finds.

Seeking the Lists
-----------------

For seeking the lists there are several functions: `jmlist_parse`, `jmlist_find`,
and `jmlist_seek_*` functions. First example is with `jmlist_parse`. Basically,
you pass a processing function which will be called for each entry in the list.

	...
	char *prefix = "This will be passed to parser function."
	s = jmlist_parse(jml,parser,prefix);
	...
	void parser(void *entry, void *param) {
		static int i=0;
		printf("parser entry %d\n",i++);
		// do something with *entry..
	}
	...

Second example is similar, but the processing function can stop the seeking loop.

	...
	s = jmlist_insert(jml,"AAA");
	s = jmlist_insert(jml,"BBB");

	void *ptr;
	jmlist_lookup_result res;
	s = jmlist_find(jml,parser,"BBB",&res,&ptr);
	if( res == jmlist_entry_found ) {
		printf("FOUND ! %s\n",ptr);
	}
	...
	jmlist_status parser(void *entry, void *param,jmlist_lookup_result *result) {
		if( !strcmp(param,entry) ) {
			*result = jmlist_entry_found;
			return JMLIST_ERROR_SUCCESS;
		}
		return JMLIST_ERROR_SUCCESS;
	}
	...


This ends the examples for this version.
